# Summary

The curriculum is a complete education in Metaphysics using online materials. It is designed to provide a well-rounded foundation equivalent to a 4-year undergraduate program in Philosophy with a specialization in Metaphysics, focusing on questions of existence, reality, being, causality, time, mind, and related topics (minus unrelated general-education requirements).

The program emphasizes critical thinking, logical argumentation, textual analysis, and philosophical writing, drawing from historical and contemporary perspectives. It prioritizes free MOOCs where available, supplemented by high-quality textbooks when necessary (authoritative paid options first, followed by free/open alternatives like the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (SEP) entries). 

Learners will develop competencies in analyzing metaphysical arguments, constructing coherent positions on ontological issues, evaluating epistemological foundations of metaphysical claims, and applying metaphysical concepts to real-world problems like personal identity or free will.

## Organization

- *Intro Metaphysics*: Orientation and fundamentals to test fit, build study habits, and cover basic philosophy including introductory metaphysics and logic.
- *Core Metaphysics*: Roughly the first three years of a major; required foundational topics including general metaphysics, epistemology (as it underpins metaphysical knowledge claims), history of philosophy (focusing on metaphysical thinkers), and philosophy of mind.
- *Advanced Metaphysics*: Final-year style electives; choose one concentration from 2–4 paths (e.g., Ontology, Philosophy of Mind, Philosophy of Time and Causality, Modal Metaphysics) to develop deeper expertise, completing all recommended resources within the chosen path.
- *Final Project*: A capstone to consolidate, validate, and showcase knowledge; peer-review ready.

**Duration**.
1–2 years, ~20 hours/week, carefully planned to be sustainable. This assumes 4–6 "semesters" of 12–15 weeks each, with breaks for reflection.

Note: When there are courses or books that don't fit into the curriculum but are otherwise of high quality,
they belong in [extras/courses](extras/courses.md), [extras/readings](extras/readings.md) or [extras/other_curricula](extras/other_curricula.md).

**Process**. Students can work through the curriculum alone or in groups, in order or out of order.

- We recommend doing all courses in **Core**, only skipping a course when you are certain that you've already learned the material previously.
- For simplicity, we recommend working through courses (especially Core) in order from top to bottom. Some students choose to study multiple courses at a time in order to vary the material they are working on in a day/week.
- The courses in the Advanced section are electives. Choose one track to specialize in and complete all the courses listed under it.

# Curriculum

- [Intro Metaphysics](#intro)
- [Core Metaphysics](#core)
- [Advanced Metaphysics](#advanced)
    - [Ontology](#ontology)
    - [Philosophy of Mind](#philosophy-of-mind)
    - [Philosophy of Time and Causality](#philosophy-of-time-and-causality)
