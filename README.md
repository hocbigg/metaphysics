# Summary

The curriculum is a complete education in Metaphysics using online materials. It is designed to provide a well-rounded foundation equivalent to a 4-year undergraduate program in Philosophy with a specialization in Metaphysics, focusing on questions of existence, reality, being, causality, time, mind, and related topics (minus unrelated general-education requirements).

The program emphasizes critical thinking, logical argumentation, textual analysis, and philosophical writing, drawing from historical and contemporary perspectives. It prioritizes free MOOCs where available, supplemented by high-quality textbooks when necessary (authoritative paid options first, followed by free/open alternatives like the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (SEP) entries). 

Learners will develop competencies in analyzing metaphysical arguments, constructing coherent positions on ontological issues, evaluating epistemological foundations of metaphysical claims, and applying metaphysical concepts to real-world problems like personal identity or free will.

## Organization

- *Intro Metaphysics*: Orientation and fundamentals to test fit, build study habits, and cover basic philosophy including introductory metaphysics and logic.
- *Core Metaphysics*: Roughly the first three years of a major; required foundational topics including general metaphysics, epistemology (as it underpins metaphysical knowledge claims), history of philosophy (focusing on metaphysical thinkers), and philosophy of mind.
- *Advanced Metaphysics*: Final-year style electives; choose one concentration from 2–4 paths (e.g., Ontology, Philosophy of Mind, Philosophy of Time and Causality, Modal Metaphysics) to develop deeper expertise, completing all recommended resources within the chosen path.
- *Final Project*: A capstone to consolidate, validate, and showcase knowledge; peer-review ready.

**Duration**.
1–2 years, ~20 hours/week, carefully planned to be sustainable. This assumes 4–6 "semesters" of 12–15 weeks each, with breaks for reflection.

Note: When there are courses or books that don't fit into the curriculum but are otherwise of high quality,
they belong in [extras/courses](extras/courses.md), [extras/readings](extras/readings.md) or [extras/other_curricula](extras/other_curricula.md).

**Process**. Students can work through the curriculum alone or in groups, in order or out of order.

- We recommend doing all courses in **Core**, only skipping a course when you are certain that you've already learned the material previously.
- For simplicity, we recommend working through courses (especially Core) in order from top to bottom. Some students choose to study multiple courses at a time in order to vary the material they are working on in a day/week.
- The courses in the Advanced section are electives. Choose one track to specialize in and complete all the courses listed under it.

<!-- /TOC -->

Note: The overall sequence is linear (Intro → Core → Advanced), but logic can be studied alongside intro courses. 

## Intro Metaphysics

These provide orientation, test interest, and build essential skills like argumentation and reading philosophical texts.

| Subject | Why study? | Book | Videos |
| :--- | :--- | --- | --- |
| Introduction to Philosophy | Provides foundational orientation to philosophy, including key areas like epistemology, metaphysics, and philosophy of mind, building essential skills in argumentation and critical thinking. |  | [Introduction to Philosophy](https://www.coursera.org/learn/philosophy) |
| Reality Bites: Introduction to Metaphysics | Introduces core metaphysical concepts such as universals, substance, time, causality, persistence, and composition through accessible analogies, testing interest in metaphysical problems. |  | [Reality Bites: Introduction to Metaphysics](https://www.coursera.org/learn/metaphysics) |
| Language, Proof and Logic | Develops formal logic skills essential for rigorous metaphysical argumentation, covering proofs, semantics, and first-order logic to analyze philosophical claims precisely. |  | [Language, Proof and Logic](https://www.edx.org/course/language-proof-and-logic) |

## Core Metaphysics

Builds foundational knowledge equivalent to lower- and upper-division coursework. Emphasize practice: weekly essays on readings, group discussions for critique.

| Subject | Why study? | Book | Videos |
| :--- | :--- | --- | --- |
| Metaphysics | Establishes core metaphysical foundations on existence, mind-body problem, personal identity, causation, and free will, equivalent to advanced undergraduate coursework. |  | [Metaphysics](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/24-221-metaphysics-spring-2015/) |
| Epistemology | Explores the nature of knowledge, justification, skepticism, and sources of belief, providing tools to evaluate metaphysical claims about reality and certainty. | *Epistemology* by Richard Fumerton; free alternative: SEP articles on [Epistemology](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology/) and [Skepticism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/skepticism/) |  |

## Final Project

A culminating project to apply and demonstrate knowledge: Write a 15–20 page original philosophical paper on a metaphysical topic (e.g., "Is Time Real? A Defense of Eternalism" or "Ontological Commitments in Quantum Mechanics"), integrating concepts from Intro, Core, and chosen Advanced path.

Scoped and structured stages: (1) Planning (4 weeks: proposal, literature review using SEP/PhilPapers, outline); (2) Development (8 weeks: drafting arguments, counterarguments, revisions); (3) Completion (4 weeks: final edit, abstract, bibliography).

Goals: Synthesize theory/methods, argue rigorously, showcase critical skills. Deliverables: Paper, 5–10 minute video presentation (record via Zoom). Evaluation: Self-assess against rubric (clarity, originality, evidence); seek peer review via r/askphilosophy, academic forums, or study groups. 

Optional: Submit to undergraduate philosophy journals or blogs for validation. This consolidates learning and prepares for further study or teaching.

## Congratulations

After completing the requirements of the curriculum above,
you will have completed the equivalent of a full bachelor's degree in Metaphysics.
Congratulations!
