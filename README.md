# Summary

The curriculum is a complete education in Metaphysics using online materials. It is designed to provide a well-rounded foundation equivalent to a 4-year undergraduate program in Philosophy with a specialization in Metaphysics, focusing on questions of existence, reality, being, causality, time, mind, and related topics (minus unrelated general-education requirements).

The program emphasizes critical thinking, logical argumentation, textual analysis, and philosophical writing, drawing from historical and contemporary perspectives. It prioritizes free MOOCs where available, supplemented by high-quality textbooks when necessary (authoritative paid options first, followed by free/open alternatives like the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (SEP) entries). 

Learners will develop competencies in analyzing metaphysical arguments, constructing coherent positions on ontological issues, evaluating epistemological foundations of metaphysical claims, and applying metaphysical concepts to real-world problems like personal identity or free will. The philosophy is self-paced, sustainable, and community-oriented, encouraging use of course forums, Reddit (e.g., r/metaphysics, r/askphilosophy), or Discord study groups for discussion, along with habits like active note-taking, spaced repetition for key concepts, and regular essay drafting.

## Organization
- *Intro Metaphysics*: Orientation and fundamentals to test fit, build study habits, and cover basic philosophy including introductory metaphysics and logic.
- *Core Metaphysics*: Roughly the first three years of a major; required foundational topics including general metaphysics, epistemology (as it underpins metaphysical knowledge claims), history of philosophy (focusing on metaphysical thinkers), and philosophy of mind.
- *Advanced Metaphysics*: Final-year style electives; choose one concentration from 2–4 paths (e.g., Ontology, Philosophy of Mind, Philosophy of Time and Causality, Modal Metaphysics) to develop deeper expertise, completing all recommended resources within the chosen path.
- *Final Project*: A capstone to consolidate, validate, and showcase knowledge; peer-review ready.

**Duration**.
1–2 years, ~20 hours/week, carefully planned to be sustainable. This assumes 4–6 "semesters" of 12–15 weeks each, with breaks for reflection. Total estimated effort: 1,000–2,000 hours. Learners can adjust pace based on background; intro and logic can be taken in parallel with lighter core courses.

# Curriculum

Prerequisites are indicated in the tables; the overall sequence is linear (Intro → Core → Advanced), but logic can be studied alongside intro courses. For a prerequisite graph: All Core courses require Intro Philosophy; Metaphysics requires Logic; Epistemology and Philosophy of Mind build on Metaphysics; History can be parallel to Metaphysics; Advanced requires all Core. Avoid redundancy by selecting non-overlapping courses; e.g., if Intro covers basic epistemology, Core goes deeper via textbooks.

## Intro Metaphysics

These provide orientation, test interest, and build essential skills like argumentation and reading philosophical texts. Focus on habits: weekly summaries, flashcard reviews of key terms (e.g., via Anki), and forum participation.

## Final Project

A culminating project to apply and demonstrate knowledge: Write a 15–20 page original philosophical paper on a metaphysical topic (e.g., "Is Time Real? A Defense of Eternalism" or "Ontological Commitments in Quantum Mechanics"), integrating concepts from Intro, Core, and chosen Advanced path.

Scoped and structured stages: (1) Planning (4 weeks: proposal, literature review using SEP/PhilPapers, outline); (2) Development (8 weeks: drafting arguments, counterarguments, revisions); (3) Completion (4 weeks: final edit, abstract, bibliography).

Goals: Synthesize theory/methods, argue rigorously, showcase critical skills. Deliverables: Paper, 5–10 minute video presentation (record via Zoom). Evaluation: Self-assess against rubric (clarity, originality, evidence); seek peer review via r/askphilosophy, academic forums, or study groups. 

Optional: Submit to undergraduate philosophy journals or blogs for validation. This consolidates learning and prepares for further study or teaching.
